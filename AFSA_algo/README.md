# Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (Python Implementation)

## Introduction
This is a Python re-implementation of the **Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA)**. 

I originally researched and implemented this algorithm during my undergraduate thesis (**"Research on Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm"**) under the supervision of **Prof. Yao**. 

As I am transitioning into Computer Science and Big Data, I have reconstructed the core logic of AFSA using **Python** and **NumPy** to demonstrate my current understanding of:
- Swarm Intelligence Optimization
- Mathematical Modeling
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Algorithm Overview
AFSA simulates the behaviors of fish to solve optimization problems. The core behaviors implemented in this project include:
1.  **Preying Behavior**: Moving towards food (local search).
2.  **Swarming Behavior**: Gathering in groups to avoid danger and find resources.
3.  **Following Behavior**: Following the most successful fish in the neighborhood.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
